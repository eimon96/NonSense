# 🕹️ NonSense — Sense Controllers as Mouse

Control your mouse using **PS VR2 Sense Controllers** on Windows with Node.js and node-hid.
Move the cursor with the analog stick, click with buttons — 'cause' why not?

- Analog stick = mouse movement
- Cross / Square = **Left click**
- L2 / R2 = **Right click**
