# ðŸŽ® NonSense â€” Sense Controller(s) as Mouse

Control your mouse using **PSVR2 Sense Controllers** using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en), [node-hid](https://github.com/node-hid/node-hid) and [robotjs](https://github.com/octalmage/robotjs).  
Read HID input and convert it to mouse output. 

- Analog Stick = Cursor Movement
- Cross / Square = **Left click**
- L2 / R2 = **Right click**

Tested on *Win11*, *Node v22.14.0* and *Bluetooth*.  
No release build will be provided, as this is more of a proof of concept.  
Feel free to modify the code to suit your needs. "Play Has No Limits" kisses Sony ðŸ˜‡

*Demo*

Demonstrating only the right controller, as the left one has drift; however, the functionality is the same.
